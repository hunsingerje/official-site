    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#1</p>try and stay organized. keeping up with registration, taxes, bills, events, appointments, and school gets difficult fast. use a planner & a personal calendar, preferably apps. for physical things, get an accordion binder or a lockbox.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#2</p>visit <a href="https://vote.gov/">vote.gov</a>; register to vote wherever you move to, even as a college student. mayoral and city council elections in COS are in april! no matter where you are, voting is not just about choosing the president. your vote makes the most impact in local elections! <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Main_Page">ballotpedia</a> is a great website for looking up candidates & their positions on different issues. <a href="https://elections.ca/home.aspx">elections.ca</a> is canada's voting info hub.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#3</p>utilize mom & dad’s benefits that extend to you for as long as you can when and if applicable. this includes those free standby plane rides, the free comprehensive health insurance. keep scheduling those yearly medical and dental checkups!</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#4</p>if dad hasn’t already set up a retirement stock account for you, please do so! i know it’s not exciting, but the earlier you start, the exponentially less you have to put in consistently to reach your goal. putting side cash into a general stock account is a good idea too. investment apps help you do that on your own without a broker.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#5</p>filing taxes is not very fun either but alas is necessary to avoid the felony of tax evasion. not sure what your situation will look like but dad or i would be happy to sit with you to walk through what to do. in america, you can pretty easily use <a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/free-file-fillable-forms">free file fillable forms</a>. canada uses <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/netfile-overview.html">NETFILE</a>. your college’s international student resources can help you also with this if you make any money (even part-time) while living there.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#6</p>get your bank app and check your personal accounts at least once a month in case of fraudulent purchases. it *will* happen, and you will be glad you checked.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#7</p>explore, but be safe doing it! <a href="https://kuros.com/products/kuros-pepper-spray">kuros</a> was that brand of pepper spray i told you about, it’s easy to use and convenient to keep on your keychain. change it out ~once a year.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#8</p>when possible, wear weather proof boots to any crowded event. think concerts, festivals, parties. they go with any outfit and are easy to clean.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#9</p>salt (and some sugar) added to water is your best friend in all situations where you are less-than-hydrated.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#10</p>always check the license plate of a rideshare car before getting in.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#11</p><a href="https://transitapp.com/">the transit app</a> is a life saver if you’re in a college town or city (it’s like waze but for public transport). it’s free! use it.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#12</p>groupon is a great way to find new places to try in an area you recently moved to.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#13</p><a href="https://www.habitat.org/restores">habitat for humanity</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace">facebook marketplace</a>, <a href="https://www.freecycle.org/">freecycle</a>, <a href="https://www.ikea.com/">ikea</a>. all great places to find decent furniture & household items for very cheap.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#14</p>you might find more often than not that buying ready-made food is the best option for the sake of your sanity and intake of nutrients. always have a couple meal kits, instant meals (think soup, ramen noodles), and frozen meals on hand. get on the rewards program at all restaurants/cafes/fast food places you go to frequently & you’ll be surprised by how much free food you come across. this same thing applies to grocery stores and places you shop at frequently. also, sign up for student discounts where you can with your school email. most brands have this.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#15</p>speaking of signing up for rewards programs, make a separate spam-dedicated email address for these kinds of things. they get annoying real fast. also, register your phone number on the <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov">do not call registry</a>. this makes it federally illegal for spam companies to put you on their call lists and you can report them if they do so. <a href="https://lnnte-dncl.gc.ca/en">canada has one too</a>.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#16</p><a href="https://hunsingerje.notion.site/06c8f1ea65614490a1a6316fabded3e9?v=567363d245604e1ab5c70f1745e99861">this is my ever-growing list of recipes</a>. it includes recipes i’ve made myself and ones that i’ve found along the way, all approved by me so you know they’re good. there is a tagging system so you can sort by category.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#17</p>sit down and create a master résumé. you can pick and choose what to leave in and take out when you apply to certain jobs, but having a running list of your education, volunteer, and job experience & keeping it up to date will help you out greatly in the long run.</h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white; font-size:20px;">#18</p>take care of your skin. drink lots of water, moisturize (especially in the winter) and wear face sunscreen (especially in the summer). buy some rubber gloves to do your dishes (and clean) with in the winter to keep your hands from drying out. you can find <a href="https://www.hmart.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0c75b0d6b380af6dca3ec180c127a709/8/8/8801250971179_1_1.jpg">a super nice thick pair</a> in the home goods section of an asian market. obv you can find some at walmart/target/amazon as well.</h1>
